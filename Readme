Analog+Digital clock in one frame

Project Description

The idea behind this project
The idea behind this project is just a by taking inspiration from the home hanging clock and big digital screen clock at the railway station.

How does it work
Firstly this clock functionality is totally based on javascript functionality so the js code will fetch the machine date and timing then it will parse hr, min, sec from this date and implement some different -different logic for analog and digital clocks.
