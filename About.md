# What is Haktober Fest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio. Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!

# How to participate it?
You just need to make four contributions to open source before October 31 and can receive a free Hacktoberfest t-shirt.

# How can a beginner participate?
For beginners, they are saying that you could make contributions to documentation for some projects. But this also needs some level of effort. When I heard about Hacktoberfest, I just registered and leave it there without doing any contributions. But then I go through the list projects I find out some too easy projects to contribute to. So I`m listing here four Github repositories anyone can contribute to, itâ€™s too easy, you just need to add your Github profile name etc in their readme file. Some of them have instructions on how to contribute.
